            <p>
                In Computer Science, intermediate and advanced students are separated based on a placement test taken at the beginning of the year. Intermediate students learn the AP Computer Science A curriculum from Ms. Taricco. At the same time, advanced students tackle their Independent CS Project (ICSP), being able to come up with and create a programming project of their choice. As an advanced student, one of the projects I will cover here is my ICSP. Along with the coursework, Mass Academy students participate in the American Computer Science League (ACSL). Later in the year, students shift away from this work to do the Apps for Good project, creating an app in a group to help the community.

			<h2>level_up</h2>
			<p>
				At the start of the year, us advanced students didn't have our Independent CS Projects (ICSP) just yet. As a substitute, we worked on series of advanced logical problems in Java. The "Level Up" series consisted of 10 problems that we had to solve, and one problem I found especially interesting was finding the sum of all even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence that don't exceed four million.

			<h2>ICSP</h2>
			<p>
				Early in the year, after deploying our websites for the first time, we began work on our ICSP. The ICSP is an assignment for advanced CS students that enables them the time to work on a coding project of their choice during class. This project spans over the entirety of A and B term, where students focus on creating their Minimum Viable Product (MVP), along with extending into C and D term to finish the project.

				For my ICSP, I chose to create a voxel engine. A voxel engine is an algorithm that generates world using 3D cubes as the basic unit. Minecraft is a prime example of a voxel engine. I created mine using C++ and OpenGL. To see the early stages of my voxel engine, refer to the video on the left side or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_wPlm9S2sI">press here to watch the video on YouTube.</a>
