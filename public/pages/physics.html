                Physics is the class closest to courses you may find at other schools. This class follows the AP Physics C: Mechanics curriculum with Ms. Chase. Over the course of the year, we learn about many different physics concepts that make up the natural world, conducting various labs and taking many tests. For most topics, we learn about both algebraic and calculus-based approaches on solving problems. In addition to physics class, physics club runs during B, C, and D terms as a place to practice and go further in depth into the field as a whole.

                        During our unit on dynamics, we created our very own lab experiments to run, testing and proving a hypothesis. These experiments had to somehow involve studying the relationship between some combination of angle, mass, and acceleration of a cart. We conducted these experiments in small groups and then individually wrote lab reports on our findings. These lab reports were limited to being just a single page long, forcing us to think about what was essential to put on the report and how we could minimize the space being used by any piece of information.

                        I worked with Isaac Moore and Abhiraam Venigalla during the lab. We decided to study the relationship between the mass of a hanging object and the acceleration of a cart it was tied to, which was traveling along a straight metal track in a modified Atwood's machine.

                        Near the start of the year, Ms. Chase assigned us a "Problem Of the Week" (POW) to work on in small groups for a few days in class. This POW regarded traffic lights at an intersection, asking students to find how much time should a light be yellow for to allow cars close to the intersection to fully cross it and others to stop right before it. This was a challenging assignment due to the number of assumptions that needed to be made depending on how in depth your group chose to analyze and model it.

                        I worked in a group with Luke Lee, Isaac Moore, and Emmanuel Yu on this assignment. For the entire problem and solution, refer to the document on the left side or <a href="../webContent/docs/physics/traffic_lights_POW.pdf" download>press here to download the PDF.</a>
