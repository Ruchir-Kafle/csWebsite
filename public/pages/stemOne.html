                The STEM course is separated into two main sections as STEM I and STEM II: the Independent Research Project (IRP) and the Assistive Technology (AT) project. STEM I, the IRP happens over the course of the majority of the first three terms of the year. During the IRP, all students research into a subject of their choosing and create a hypothesis to prove experimentally in their project. Along the way, students create various organizers to manage their progress on the project over the long expanse, along with describing their project to viewers, including MSEF (the organization which projects are submitted to). Significant assignments include the MSEF proposal, the Grant Proposal, and poster creation.

			<p>During A, B, and C term, we students work on our IRPs. When we deploy our websites for the midway point of the year, we have yet to have finished the projects yet. As such, Dr. Crowthers has us create and deploy a quad chart, a small chart visualizing and explaining our project.</p>

				My project revolves around data compression, specifically neural compression, a subsection that involves the use of neural networks to compress files into a smaller form factor. In my project, I plan to prove that data compressors can indeed compress data down to the entropy limit, the smallest possible size a piece of data can be represented within. I am using Large Language Models in order to achieve this goal.
