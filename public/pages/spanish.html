                At Mass Academy, students are required to take a language course throughout their junior year. Students have the option of taking French or Spanish depending on what language course they took at their sending school. If they didn’t take one of these courses at their sending school, they will have to pick one of the two languages to take junior year. Based on placement in language, students are split into different sections where advanced students are separated from intermediate students. As an intermediate Spanish student, during class we learned the basics of the language, learning various conjugations and becoming more advanced.

                        In intermediate Spanish, when we were learning about reflexive verbs, that is verbs that one does on oneself, we wrote a short excerpt about how our typical day goes. The excerpt was to use these reflexive verbs within them. Later on, we went through our own responses during class to check and correct for any errors before handing them back in to Señora Wildfong.

                        My essay did end up turning out to be a bit on the longer side and did have minimal reflexive verbs. During a Spanish class after writing this piece, I would correct the errors that Señora Wildfong identified in my writing.

                        As an way to learn more descriptive words, but also practice speaking in Spanish, Señora Wildfong had us prepare a slideshow about an artist. During a class, she went through everybody, asking each person to pick from a list of artists, with one or two people getting each artist. With this artist, we spent some time finding three pieces the artist painted, preparing a slideshow to show the paintings to the class, along with a single notecard to use to help present. When presenting, we had to say a few sentences, pointing out various objects in the painting and what they look like.

                        For my artist, I picked Joan Miró, a well known painter from Spain. To see some of the painting he painted in his lifetime, refer to my slideshow on the left or <a href="../webContent/docs/spanish/art_presentation.pdf" download>press here to download the PDF.</a>
