            <p>
                Humanities is a mix of English Language Arts (ELA) and history, teaching about how pieces of literature and people were affected by the circumstances of their time. This course discusses a wide range of topics, such as diversity, identity, and many other societally intrinsic concepts. Following a more typical English course, Ms. Small teaches about rhetoric, satire, and much more. During the span of the year, many large assignments such as timed essays and presentations. Historically, we also entered a few contests, such as the New York Times Multimedia Challenge.

                    	<p>
				One of, if not our first essays for the entire year was a timed write. During a 2-hour long all-school, a period when all students are in the brickyard (our cafeteria) for a class, we started and finished essays with prompts of our choice. Not everything was on the spot, as Ms. Small had introduced us to the assignment and allowed us to create our prompts about AI's role in education days in advance. In addition to this, she allowed us to create an outline for our essay prior to writing it.

				As the culmination of our unit on satire, we wrote essays analyzing the use of satire in passages of our choice. We wrote this essay over the course of around a week during class, right before Christmas break.
