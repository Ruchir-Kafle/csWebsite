                During junior year, students participate in many different math activities. Several competitions occur over the course of the year, such as the New England Math League (NEML), the High School Mathematical Modeling Competition (HiMCM), and the longest-term project, the Modeling the Future Challenge (MTFC). Over the course of the year as well, we learned about various topics like modeling data, Algebra & Geometry, Statistics, and Pre-Calculus. Those who have already taken AP Statistics or AP Calculus are separated from those who have not when the given topic is being taught in class. Advanced students learn more advanced topics, like ANOVA and Calculus 3 & 4.

				During B-term, one of the main events that all juniors participate in is the High School Mathematical Modeling Competition (HiMCM). This competition gives students two weeks to analyze a problem and come up with a mathematical solution, with models, on how to solve that problem. At Mass Academy, we receive 50 hours to spend doing this problem straight. For two and a half days of school from Wednesday to Friday, this contest is our only concern. Prior to this assignment however, in small groups we did some practice writing solutions for problems of previous years.

			<h2>MTFC_project_proposal:</h2>
			
			<p>
				Throughout the year, we work in groups chosen by ourselves to work on the longest competition of the year in Math Modeling, the Modeling the Future Challenge. In this challenge, your group comes up with a problem to research into and analyze mathematically. The goal of the project is to come up with and propose a solution to a large problem with the intent of helping the group challenged by this problem.

				My MTFC group consisted of me, Liam Bratane, Suhrit Ghosh, Aashriya Das, and Donya Darawcheh. For our project, we wanted to look into the significant problem of suicide amongst adolescent gamers.
